    "# baseball-predictor.ipynb based on hello-world-predictor\n",
    "# Objective: Read the dataset, do a simple prediction for games on a given date using data prior to that date, then\n",
    "#            and record some stats on how well it did.\n",
    "# \n",
    "#\n",
    "# 12/21/19, Alexis: Currently this \"helloworld\" predictor is very simple. It does the following:\n",
    "#  1. Reads in the 2010 season as the baseline games dataset. It does some simple selection\n",
    "#     of columns and generates a few calculated fields.\n",
    "#  2. It prompts the user to specify 'game day' which are the games it is to predict.\n",
    "#  3. It calculates the avg net number of runs for the home team (when playing at home) and\n",
    "#     the avg net number of runs for the visiting team (when playing away).\n",
    "#  4. For a given game, the predicted winner is the team with the greatest avg net runs at\n",
    "#     home or away (as applicable).\n",
    "#  5. The prediction is compared with the actual results that day, with % correct reported.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#  Proposed next steps:\n",
    "#  1. Integrate Venkat's \"concat\" capability to combine datasets across year blocks to result\n",
    "#     in a much larger dataset. Note that for development we may want to keep the dataset\n",
    "#     smaller size so that it doesn't take a long time to run.\n",
    "#  2. Move this out of jupyter notebook into standard Python and embed the prediction logic\n",
    "#     into a function that can be called repeatedly with different dates.\n",
    "#  3. Run trials with large numbers of dates to product large numbers of predictions and\n",
    "#     results.\n",
    "#  4. Write results to a file. Possibly generate some plot of results as a function of\n",
    "#     training set window size.\n",
    "#  5. Start experimenting with diffent prediction functions, initially across individual\n",
    "#     factors, and then with multiple factors.\n",
    "#  6. Consider a statistically meaningful regresssion analysis to select factors and training\n",
    "#     set window size, by factor.\n",
    "#  7. If someone has energy, consider using a web API to hit a website with current day\n",
    "#     game schedule so we can predict games more recent than the dataset.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 12/21/19, Venkat : Modified the code and included the below changes\n",
    "#  1. Included the logic to combine all data files into one data frame\n",
    "#  2. Included cleanup logic to clean missing data rows if any such rows exists\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1/4/20, Alexis: Extend from \"hello-world\" to a useful predictor harness.\n",
    "#  1. Implement a window to constrain the lookback period to n gamedays.\n",
    "#  2. Add support for predicting a range of dates, not just one day.\n"
