UCSD Data Science Team Project: Predict the winner of baseball games.


UCSD Data Science Bootcamp Project 1 Proposal, 12/18/19
MLB Game Winner Predictor

Team Members:
•	Venkateswarlu Pinnika
•	Young You
•	Alexis Perumal

Project Objective
•	Build a predictive model that can predict the winner of an MLB game, before it starts.

Project Description/Outline
•	Brainstorm the concept
•	Browse the dataset
•	Evaluate which factors drive runs
•	Build a simple 1 or 2 factor predictive model. Evaluate it. Tune it.
•	Layer additional factors as time allows.
•	Pull it together.
•	Write it up
•	Present it.

Research Questions to Answer
•	What factors drive runs and game outcomes?
•	What is a reasonable expectation for predictive accuracy? Presumably 50% accurate is easy to do (random should do that). How much better can we do?
•	Should we consider a point spread?

Datasets to use
•	SeanLahman.com – provides rich baseball game outcome for every MLB game going back to 1881. It includes game outcomes, player data, at bats, pitches.
•	We wouldn’t expect to use all that data. We would select what is most useful.
•	It is available as a CSV file.
•	The dataset is very rich, across multiple tables, so we don’t think other sources will be needed, but if we get the itch, we’ll find what else we can get.

Rough Breakdown of Tasks 
•	Project Design and Strategy
•	Build and Release Management (manage git)
•	Technical architecture of the Jupyter notebook
•	Final analysis and write-up
•	Demo and Presentation
